    <p>Space and time were once thought to be separate quantities. However, the concept of spacetime combines both and explores their interrelation. Time and distance are not consistent values; they change depending on the observer. One assumption must be applied: the speed of light is constant and finite, approximately 2.99 × 10<sup>8</sup> metres per second.</p>

    <p>For example, if one observer moves with a light source while another remains stationary, each will measure different distances travelled by the light. The moving observer sees the speed of light as the constant c and records the time, allowing them to calculate distance. The stationary observer must also account for the motion of the first observer along with the light source. This results in two different measurements. A relationship between these measurements shows that both distance and time are observed differently depending entirely on when and where they are measured.</p>

    <p>This gives us a basic understanding of time and space dilation. Space is the distance between objects. In one dimension, space is absolute. In higher dimensions, however, observers may perceive different distances. For example, consider the line below:</p>

    <p>Straight on from this view, it only looks like a straight line. Now imagine that this line is three-dimensional and extends off the page. If you turn the page to the side, will you still see a straight line? Obviously not—you only see the cross-sectional area of the line. In one dimension, we do not have enough information about the shape of this line. It could have a circular, square, or rectangular cross-section. Similarly, a person observing the shape only from the side has no information about its extension; to them, it may appear flat, or it could extend infinitely.</p>

    <p>If we apply Euclidean geometry to calculate the length of the line in two dimensions, we arrive at the familiar equation:</p>
    <p>d<sup>2</sup> = (Δx)<sup>2</sup> + (Δy)<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>Where d is the distance between two points, Δx is the change in the x-coordinate, and Δy is the change in the y-coordinate.</p>

    <p>Similarly, in the third dimension, the equation becomes:</p>
    <p>d<sup>2</sup> = (Δx)<sup>2</sup> + (Δy)<sup>2</sup> + (Δz)<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>Where d is the distance between two points, and Δx, Δy, and Δz are the changes in the x, y, and z coordinates, respectively.</p>

    <p>In spacetime, time is no longer treated as a separate metric from the spatial dimensions x, y, and z. Instead, it is incorporated using the same metric by expressing it as ct, where c is the speed of light. Since c has units of distance over time, multiplying it by t converts time into a distance metric, allowing it to be measured on the same scale as the spatial dimensions.</p>

    <p>The original field equation can be solved into ten separate nonlinear differential equations. One of these brings us to the Schwarzschild solution of a perfect black hole which consists purely of mass and no rotation or charge. Let’s bring back the original Einstein field equation for the third time:</p>
    <p>G<sub>μν</sub> + Λ g<sub>μν</sub> = 8πG/c<sup>4</sup> T<sub>μν</sub></p>

    <p>Each tensor in the equation above relates to a different aspect of the components of general relativity. Let’s also bring back the famous:</p>
    <p>E = mc<sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>E = energy</li>
      <li>m = mass</li>
      <li>c = speed of light</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is a scalar equation; each value is simple and unique. Another famous equation in physics is:</p>
    <p>F = ma</p>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>F = force</li>
      <li>m = mass</li>
      <li>a = acceleration</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This equation is a vector because it has x, y, and z-dimensional values. This shows that we view our Universe as three-dimensional. In general relativity, the Universe is represented in four dimensions (three spatial dimensions and one time dimension). It also has two indices. According to this assumption, the Einstein Field Equation can be manipulated into sixteen different equations, where each factor of four dimensions can impact another set of four dimensions.</p>

    <p>As we’ve encountered before, we describe spacetime as a Pseudo-Riemannian manifold. In this type of manifold, curvature can be categorized in two ways: one category impacts the volume of the object, and the other impacts the shape of the object. The Ricci component impacts the Einstein tensor as it relates to the distortion of volume.</p>

    <p>Ten nonlinear differential equations can be derived from the Field Equation. Differential equations are equations where:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>All initial conditions of the system can be accurately determined.</li>
      <li>These conditions are values that can be put into the equation appropriately.</li>
      <li>The equation will then be able to inform you about how these conditions change over time.</li>
      <li>This new information should then be put back into the equation to inform one on what happens in the next instant.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>There are sixteen equations, but six of them are identical because the ‘xy’ component is essentially the same as the ‘yx’ component. It does not matter which way the items are multiplied. Additionally, there are four relationships that connect the remaining ten equations, called the Bianchi Identities. This means that there are only six independent equations at the end.</p>

    <p>General relativity is nonlinear, so you cannot sum two outcomes together if two variables are set together. For example, in Newtonian gravity, to find the gravitational force of a larger object made of two smaller ones, you simply add each of their forces to find the total force. However, in Einstein’s theory of gravity, this approach does not apply.</p>

    <p>With all this said, more complex mathematics can be applied to find the Schwarzschild metric (a link to this will be attached here for those who are interested: <a href="https://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/bh/schwp.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Schwarzschild%20metric,expected%20in%20a%20flat%2C%20Euclidean" class="inline-link">Schwarzschild metric reference</a>).</p>

    <p>dS<sup>2</sup> = (1 - 2GM/(c<sup>2</sup> r)) c<sup>2</sup> dt<sup>2</sup> - (1 - 2GM/(c<sup>2</sup> r))<sup>-1</sup> dr<sup>2</sup> - r<sup>2</sup> dθ<sup>2</sup> - r<sup>2</sup> sin<sup>2</sup>θ dφ<sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>dS<sup>2</sup> is the spacetime interval squared.</li>
      <li>G is the gravitational constant.</li>
      <li>M is the mass of the black hole.</li>
      <li>c is the speed of light.</li>
      <li>r, θ, φ are spherical coordinates.</li>
      <li>dt is the differential time element.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The first term represents the time component, showing how time slows down near a massive object. The other terms account for the radial and angular components of spacetime curvature.</p>

    <p>Under the condition that c = 2GM/c<sup>2</sup>, we get the Schwarzschild radius equation. The Schwarzschild metric describes the behavior of spacetime around a point mass, assumed to be perfectly spherical, with no charge and no rotational forces. This defines a Schwarzschild black hole.</p>

    <p>One solution to the Schwarzschild equation is r = 0, corresponding to the singularity at the center of the black hole. The second solution gives the Schwarzschild radius, which defines the size of the event horizon.</p>

    <p>Despite being theorized over 250 years ago, black holes remain some of the most mysterious and extreme objects in the Universe. They are massive, dense, and scattered across space, marking the deaths of the largest stars. While our understanding of black holes is still developing, mathematics allows us to describe and predict their behavior with remarkable precision. The Schwarzschild black hole serves as a fundamental model for more complex black holes, and continued study pushes the boundaries of human knowledge. Mathematics enables us to think, create, and progress as a species.</p>
