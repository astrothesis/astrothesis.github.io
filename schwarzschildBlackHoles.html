  <p>Mathematics is of no use to us when it exists as pen on paper or chalk upon a board. It is in its application that it becomes a fundamental tool—transforming imagination into reality. Physics allows us to apply mathematics to matter, to predict the behaviour and motion of particles through space and time, and to turn this knowledge into something we can think with, create with, and progress with as a species.</p>

  <p>Mathematics is deeply embedded in astrophysics, where it is used to build theories we cannot yet explore because of the limits of space travel and the enormity of the Universe itself. The Schwarzschild black hole owes its name to Karl Schwarzschild, a German physicist born in the late 1800s. Alongside Einstein’s newly emergent theory of general relativity, Schwarzschild was able to mathematically describe the “perfect” black hole. The Schwarzschild solution is often spoken of as an elegant entity—“compact, exact, and beautiful”.</p>

  <h2>What Is a Black Hole?</h2>

  <p>Stars are vast, dense spheres of matter. Anything with mass creates gravity, pulling inwards toward its centre. Because stars are so dense, they have an intense gravitational centre that must be held back to prevent collapse. This balance is sustained by nuclear fusion: the collision of atomic nuclei in the star’s core to create larger nuclei and subatomic particles, releasing immense amounts of energy. That outward energy resists the inward pull of gravity, keeping the star alive.</p>

  <p>But when a star of great mass reaches its end, the balance falters. The fuel that fed its core runs out, the outward pressure fades, and gravity takes hold. Some stars collapse into neutron stars, but if the star is massive enough, no force in the Universe can halt the fall. What remains is a singularity—an infinitely dense point where spacetime itself breaks down. For a long time, many scientists believed that such things, though mathematically possible, could never truly form. Even Albert Einstein doubted that black holes could exist in the Universe.</p>

  <p>Escape velocity helps us glimpse why. It is the speed required to escape a body’s gravitational pull. As mass is crushed into smaller and smaller spaces, escape velocity climbs. When the required speed surpasses the speed of light, not even light can break free. What cannot release light cannot be seen, and so the object becomes dark—a black hole. The escape velocity of any body is given by:</p>

  <p>$$ v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}} $$</p>

  <p>Where:</p>

  <p>⭐️ v_e: escape velocity</p>

  <p>⭐️ G: gravitational constant</p>

  <p>⭐️ M: mass of the body to be escaped</p>

  <p>⭐️ r: distance from the centre of mass of this body</p>

  <h2>What Types of Black Holes Are There and What Makes Schwarzschild Black Holes Special?</h2>

  <p>Black holes are defined by their event horizons—the invisible boundaries separating the inside from the outside of the black hole. This boundary lies at the Schwarzschild radius. Outside the horizon, mathematics allows us to predict the motion of matter. But once inside, spacetime behaves according to laws so different from our own that prediction becomes impossible. According to solutions to Einstein’s general relativity, four types of black holes may exist:</p>

  <p>⭐️ Schwarzschild black holes: perfectly spherical, with no charge and no rotation.</p>

  <p>⭐️ Reissner–Nordström black holes: possess mass and charge, but no rotation.</p>

  <p>⭐️ Kerr black holes: mass and rotation, with flattened poles due to their spin.</p>

  <p>⭐️ Kerr–Newman black holes: combine mass, charge, and rotation.</p>

  <p>Schwarzschild black holes are special because the mathematics describing them is exact. They are the simplest form of black hole and serve as a theoretical model to help us grasp what occurs beyond the event horizon. Yet they are unlikely to exist in reality, since true black holes almost always rotate and may appear to carry charge by attracting matter. If you reach the event horizon, escape is impossible: the required velocity exceeds the speed of light, so you would inevitably be drawn in. Beyond this, there are two main ways a black hole may consume matter. One is through orbital decay, where perturbations cause objects to spiral gradually inward until they cross the horizon. The other is through friction in the gas and dust swirling around the black hole, which slows material and pulls it past the horizon.</p>

  <h2>The Formation of the Perfect Schwarzschild Black Hole</h2>

  <p>A fixed amount of matter can be compressed until its gravity overwhelms all opposing forces. Once this imbalance arises, collapse occurs within milliseconds, unstoppable as the star implodes under immense pressure. Such collapse is often triggered in supernova explosions. Another path arises from the accumulation of mass: when a body grows immense enough, its gravity can no longer be resisted. This second route is seen in the collision of neutron stars.</p>

  <p>Mathematically, anything could become a black hole if compressed into a sufficiently dense point. In practice, only very massive stars reach such extremes. Yet, in theory, even the Earth could form a black hole if its mass were crushed into a sphere just 9 mm across. Imagine all mountains and oceans condensed into a single pinpoint. At such a density, if you stood as close to it as you are to these words, you would have long since dissolved into a puddle of quarks.</p>

  <p>Black holes of Earth’s size have never been observed, and likely never will be. The Universe does not naturally compress ordinary matter with such inefficiency. Rock and metal are stable enough, at this scale, to resist collapse. Only the titanic densities of stars allow spacetime to warp so severely that it becomes something entirely different.</p>

  <p>The possible event horizon of any object can be calculated using the Schwarzschild radius equation:</p>

  <p>$$ r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} $$</p>

  <p>Where:</p>

  <p>⭐️ r_s: Schwarzschild radius (event horizon)</p>

  <p>⭐️ G: gravitational constant</p>

  <p>⭐️ M: mass of the object</p>

  <p>⭐️ c: speed of light in a vacuum</p>

  <p>That’s if an object is compressed to extreme density. But what if, instead, mass is added until the object’s gravitational pull becomes immense? In that case, the Schwarzschild radius can be determined simply by calculating the total mass of the object. Mass can be expressed as:</p>

  <p>$$ m = \rho \times V $$</p>

  <p>Where:</p>

  <p>⭐️ M = mass of the object</p>

  <p>⭐️ rho = density of the object</p>

  <p>⭐️ V = volume of the object</p>

  <p>For a roughly spherical object, volume can be written as:</p>

  <p>$$ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 $$</p>

  <p>By substituting this expression for V into the mass formula and then placing M into the Schwarzschild radius equation:</p>

  <p>$$ r_s = \frac{2G (\rho V)}{c^2} = \frac{2G \rho \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{c^2} $$</p>

  <p>we can relate the Schwarzschild radius directly to the density and radius of the object. The larger the mass or the denser the object, the greater the radius at which an event horizon would form.</p>

  <p>The fact that any object could, in theory, become a Schwarzschild black hole is invaluable to scientists. It allows them to experiment on any scale, with any material, to conceptualise the size of a black hole’s singularity and event horizon. Understanding these sizes helps scientists predict the behaviour of matter around black holes of different masses and densities—much of which remains mysterious. This approach provides a strong foundation, especially considering that real black holes are influenced by additional factors such as rotation and charge.</p>

  <h2>When Did Schwarzschild Black Holes First Appear?</h2>

  <p>The concept of black holes has been around for centuries. The earliest mentions date back to the 1700s, when Pierre Laplace contemplated the idea of objects in space with gravitational forces so immense that even light could not escape. He referred to them as “black stars”. At the time, however, mathematical tools were limited, and the physics of space was still largely unexplored, preventing further investigation. It was only after Einstein formulated his general relativity equations that physicists such as Karl Schwarzschild could rigorously theorise the effects of extreme gravity. One of these theoretical solutions eventually led to the rediscovery of black holes. Einstein’s general relativity equation is as follows:</p>

  <p>$$ G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu} $$</p>

  <h2>A (Not So) Short Diversion to General Relativity</h2>

  <p>Albert Einstein is famous for many things. Perhaps his most notable contribution is the classic equation:</p>

  <p>$$ E = mc^2 $$</p>

  <p>The equation cruises the front covers of science books, novelty t-shirts, and chalkboards of university lecture halls. But what exactly does it mean? ‘E’ in this case is energy, and ‘m’ is mass. ‘c’ is the constant value of the speed of light. The equation simply states that energy and mass are interchangeable when the speed of light is constant.</p>

  <p>But this equation is not the one relevant to general relativity. Einstein’s equation of general relativity may seem complex, but it can be rearranged into sixteen distinct equations that theorise multiple circumstances involving gravity. In general relativity, space and time are not separate entities; they rely on each other to form the fabric of the Universe. Time is a physical dimension, which, when layered with space, creates spacetime. Everything moves through this dimension forwards toward the ‘future’. Under this framework, not everything exists in the same time span simultaneously. While we are currently in the twenty-first century, other planets and stars may still be in the early stages of the Universe, where expansion is rapid and everything is hot and fiery.</p>

  <p>Gravity, therefore, is the curvature of spacetime itself. It is not a force acting at a distance between objects but the warping of the dimension in which those objects exist. According to Newtonian laws, an object in motion continues in that motion unless disturbed by an external force. Following this principle, objects moving through spacetime prefer to continue in a straight line at their current speed. When they encounter warps in spacetime, their paths are altered. These paths are referred to as geodesics.</p>

  <p>Spacetime cannot warp randomly; otherwise, the Universe would be chaotic, and gravity would vary unpredictably. The warps surround objects according to their mass. Imagine a loosely suspended tablecloth: place a marble on one spot and a basketball on another. You would observe the fabric dipping more under the basketball because it is heavier. Similarly, planets and stars are like marbles and basketballs on the tablecloth of the Universe, each warping spacetime according to its mass.</p>

  <p>Another important factor is that spacetime is a Pseudo-Riemannian manifold. But what does this fancy term mean? A manifold is, simply put, something that can bend. It is a topological space that follows the rules of Euclidean geometry. A topological shape can be bent or deformed, while certain points remain in consistent relations to each other within predetermined open sets. For example, you can turn a square into a circle, or a triangle into a circle, but you cannot turn a circle into a donut shape without disrupting its internal points by creating a hole.</p>

  <p>There are five postulates that determine whether something is Euclidean:</p>

  <p>🌠 A straight line must be able to connect one point to another point.</p>

  <p>🌠 A terminated line can be continued indefinitely.</p>

  <p>🌠 A circle can be drawn with any centre and radius (use of open epsilon balls).</p>

  <p>🌠 All right angles are congruent.</p>

  <p>🌠 If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, will meet on that side where the angles are less than two right angles.</p>

  <p>Euclidean geometry also relies on five axioms (statements assumed to be self-evidently true):</p>

  <p>🌠 Two things that are equal to the same thing are also equal to each other.</p>

  <p>🌠 Equals added to equals result in equal wholes.</p>

  <p>🌠 If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainder is equal.</p>

  <p>🌠 Things that coincide with each other are equal to each other.</p>

  <p>🌠 The whole is greater than the part.</p>

  <p>For something to be characterised as Pseudo-Riemannian, it must appear locally flat but be curved overall. Earth provides a simple example: standing on its surface, the horizon seems flat, but from a larger perspective, we see that Earth is curved. Similarly, spacetime is not a rigid block that objects move through, nor an irregular, wavy three-dimensional shape. It obeys Euclidean principles, appearing flat locally while being warped on a cosmic scale.</p>

  <p>If spacetime were perfectly flat, phenomena such as time relativity, time dilation, and the finite speed of light would not occur. General relativity governs spacetime as a whole, but in local instances, special relativity applies. The equations explain why objects follow geodesics and the extent to which space is curved. So, let’s bring this back to Einstein’s general relativity equation.</p>

  <p>$$ G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu} $$</p>

  <p>What exactly does it mean? Before we dive into the depths of the equation itself, let’s explore its relevance. The equation predicts how spacetime curves and how objects move depending on that curvature and their motion. Once different variations of the equation are solved, four of them dictate the four types of black holes that are theoretically possible, as seen above, and one of them is Schwarzschild’s solution.</p>

  <p>The equation is not limited to celestial bodies of specific sizes or densities. Any variable in the Universe can be applied, including the entire Universe itself. This allows scientists to visualise the spacetime dimension on a grand scale. Since time is a physical property of spacetime, understanding this curvature also allows scientists to look into the past and glimpse the future of the Universe.</p>

  <p>So now we know what gravity seems to be in general relativity—but if it is not a force, why do we feel it? An object accelerates toward the centre of the Earth because that is the direction spacetime is warped locally. However, the surface of the Earth obstructs this movement. The force we feel is the surface resisting the object, preventing it from moving toward the centre. Similarly, a planet in orbit is actually moving in a straight line, following the warp of spacetime. Now we understand general relativity and why it is related to Schwarzschild black holes.</p>

  <h2>More About Spacetime (In Case the Concept’s Still a Little Difficult to Warp Your Head Around)</h2>

  <p>Space and time were once thought to be separate quantities. However, the concept of spacetime combines both and explores their interrelation. Time and distance are not consistent values; they change depending on the observer. One assumption must be applied: the speed of light is constant and finite, approximately 2.99 \times 10^8 metres per second.</p>

  <p>For example, if one observer moves with a light source while another remains stationary, each will measure different distances travelled by the light. The moving observer sees the speed of light as the constant c and records the time, allowing them to calculate distance. The stationary observer must also account for the motion of the first observer along with the light source. This results in two different measurements. A relationship between these measurements shows that both distance and time are observed differently depending entirely on when and where they are measured.</p>

  <p>This gives us a basic understanding of time and space dilation. Space is the distance between objects. In one dimension, space is absolute. In higher dimensions, however, observers may perceive different distances. For example, consider the line below:</p>

  <p>________________________________________________________</p>

  <p> on from this view, it only looks like a straight line. Now imagine that this line is three-dimensional and extends off the page. If you turn the page to the side, will you still see a straight line? Obviously not—you only see the cross-sectional area of the line. In one dimension, we do not have enough information about the shape of this line. It could have a circular, square, or rectangular cross-section. Similarly, a person observing the shape only from the side has no information about its extension; to them, it may appear flat, or it could extend infinitely.</p>

  <p>If we apply Euclidean geometry to calculate the length of the line in two dimensions, we arrive at the familiar equation:</p>

  <p>$$ d^2 = (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 $$</p>

  <p>Where d is the distance between two points, \Delta x is the change in the x-coordinate, and \Delta y is the change in the y-coordinate.</p>

  <p>Similarly, in the third dimension, the equation becomes:</p>

  <p>$$ d^2 = (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 + (\Delta z)^2 $$</p>

  <p>Where d is the distance between two points, and \Delta x, \Delta y, and \Delta z are the changes in the x, y, and z coordinates, respectively.</p>

  <p>In spacetime, time is no longer treated as a separate metric from the spatial dimensions x, y, and z. Instead, it is incorporated using the same metric by expressing it as ct, where c is the speed of light. Since c has units of distance over time, multiplying it by t converts time into a distance metric, allowing it to be measured on the same scale as the spatial dimensions.</p>

  <p>The original field equation can be solved into ten separate nonlinear differential equations. One of these brings us to the Schwarzschild solution of a perfect black hole which consists purely of mass and no rotation or charge. Let’s bring back the original Einstein field equation for the third time:</p>

  <p>$$ G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu} $$</p>

  <p>Each tensor in the equation above relates to a different aspect of the components of general relativity. Let’s also bring back the famous:</p>

  <p>$$ E = mc^2 $$</p>

  <p>Where:</p>

  <p>⭐️ E = energy</p>

  <p>⭐️ m = mass</p>

  <p>⭐️ c = speed of light</p>

  <p>This is a scalar equation, each value is simple and unique. Another famous equation in physics is:</p>

  <p>$$ F = m \times a $$</p>

  <p>Where:</p>

  <p>⭐️ F = force</p>

  <p>⭐️ m = mass </p>

  <p>⭐️ a = acceleration</p>
