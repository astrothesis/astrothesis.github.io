  <p>Mathematics is of no use to us when it exists as pen on paper or chalk upon a board. It is in its application that it becomes a fundamental tool—transforming imagination into reality. Physics allows us to apply mathematics to matter, to predict the behaviour and motion of particles through space and time, and to turn this knowledge into something we can think with, create with, and progress with as a species.</p>

  <p>Mathematics is deeply embedded in astrophysics, where it is used to build theories we cannot yet explore because of the limits of space travel and the enormity of the Universe itself. The Schwarzschild black hole owes its name to Karl Schwarzschild, a German physicist born in the late 1800s. Alongside Einstein’s newly emergent theory of general relativity, Schwarzschild was able to mathematically describe the “perfect” black hole. The Schwarzschild solution is often spoken of as an elegant entity—“compact, exact, and beautiful”.</p>

  <h2>What Is a Black Hole?</h2>

  <p>Stars are vast, dense spheres of matter. Anything with mass creates gravity, pulling inwards toward its centre. Because stars are so dense, they have an intense gravitational centre that must be held back to prevent collapse. This balance is sustained by nuclear fusion: the collision of atomic nuclei in the star’s core to create larger nuclei and subatomic particles, releasing immense amounts of energy. That outward energy resists the inward pull of gravity, keeping the star alive.</p>

  <p>But when a star of great mass reaches its end, the balance falters. The fuel that fed its core runs out, the outward pressure fades, and gravity takes hold. Some stars collapse into neutron stars, but if the star is massive enough, no force in the Universe can halt the fall. What remains is a singularity—an infinitely dense point where spacetime itself breaks down. For a long time, many scientists believed that such things, though mathematically possible, could never truly form. Even Albert Einstein doubted that black holes could exist in the Universe.</p>

  <p>Escape velocity helps us glimpse why. It is the speed required to escape a body’s gravitational pull. As mass is crushed into smaller and smaller spaces, escape velocity climbs. When the required speed surpasses the speed of light, not even light can break free. What cannot release light cannot be seen, and so the object becomes dark—a black hole. The escape velocity of any body is given by:</p>

  <p>$$ v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}} $$</p>

  <p>Where:</p>

  <p>⭐️ v_e: escape velocity</p>

  <p>⭐️ G: gravitational constant</p>

  <p>⭐️ M: mass of the body to be escaped</p>

  <p>⭐️ r: distance from the centre of mass of this body</p>

  <h2>What Types of Black Holes Are There and What Makes Schwarzschild Black Holes Special?</h2>

  <p>Black holes are defined by their event horizons—the invisible boundaries separating the inside from the outside of the black hole. This boundary lies at the Schwarzschild radius. Outside the horizon, mathematics allows us to predict the motion of matter. But once inside, spacetime behaves according to laws so different from our own that prediction becomes impossible. According to solutions to Einstein’s general relativity, four types of black holes may exist:</p>

  <p>⭐️ Schwarzschild black holes: perfectly spherical, with no charge and no rotation.</p>

  <p>⭐️ Reissner–Nordström black holes: possess mass and charge, but no rotation.</p>

  <p>⭐️ Kerr black holes: mass and rotation, with flattened poles due to their spin.</p>

  <p>⭐️ Kerr–Newman black holes: combine mass, charge, and rotation.</p>

  <p>Schwarzschild black holes are special because the mathematics describing them is exact. They are the simplest form of black hole and serve as a theoretical model to help us grasp what occurs beyond the event horizon. Yet they are unlikely to exist in reality, since true black holes almost always rotate and may appear to carry charge by attracting matter. If you reach the event horizon, escape is impossible: the required velocity exceeds the speed of light, so you would inevitably be drawn in. Beyond this, there are two main ways a black hole may consume matter. One is through orbital decay, where perturbations cause objects to spiral gradually inward until they cross the horizon. The other is through friction in the gas and dust swirling around the black hole, which slows material and pulls it past the horizon.</p>

  <h2>The Formation of the Perfect Schwarzschild Black Hole</h2>

  <p>A fixed amount of matter can be compressed until its gravity overwhelms all opposing forces. Once this imbalance arises, collapse occurs within milliseconds, unstoppable as the star implodes under immense pressure. Such collapse is often triggered in supernova explosions. Another path arises from the accumulation of mass: when a body grows immense enough, its gravity can no longer be resisted. This second route is seen in the collision of neutron stars.</p>

  <p>Mathematically, anything could become a black hole if compressed into a sufficiently dense point. In practice, only very massive stars reach such extremes. Yet, in theory, even the Earth could form a black hole if its mass were crushed into a sphere just 9 mm across. Imagine all mountains and oceans condensed into a single pinpoint. At such a density, if you stood as close to it as you are to these words, you would have long since dissolved into a puddle of quarks.</p>

  <p>Black holes of Earth’s size have never been observed, and likely never will be. The Universe does not naturally compress ordinary matter with such inefficiency. Rock and metal are stable enough, at this scale, to resist collapse. Only the titanic densities of stars allow spacetime to warp so severely that it becomes something entirely different.</p>

  <p>The possible event horizon of any object can be calculated using the Schwarzschild radius equation:</p>

  <p>$$ r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} $$</p>

  <p>Where:</p>

  <p>⭐️ r_s: Schwarzschild radius (event horizon)</p>

  <p>⭐️ G: gravitational constant</p>

  <p>⭐️ M: mass of the object</p>

  <p>⭐️ c: speed of light in a vacuum</p>

  <p>That’s if an object is compressed to extreme density. But what if, instead, mass is added until the object’s gravitational pull becomes immense? In that case, the Schwarzschild radius can be determined simply by calculating the total mass of the object. Mass can be expressed as:</p>

  <p>$$ M = \rho \, V</p>

  <p>Where:</p>

  <p>⭐️ M = mass of the object</p>

  <p>⭐️ rho = density of the object</p>

  <p>⭐️ V = volume of the object</p>

  <p>For a roughly spherical object, volume can be written as:</p>

  <p>$$ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 $$</p>

  <p>By substituting this expression for V into the mass formula and then placing M into the Schwarzschild radius equation:</p>

  <p>$$ r_s = \frac{2G (\rho V)}{c^2} = \frac{2G \rho \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{c^2} $$</p>

  <p>we can relate the Schwarzschild radius directly to the density and radius of the object. The larger the mass or the denser the object, the greater the radius at which an event horizon would form.</p>

  <p>The fact that any object could, in theory, become a Schwarzschild black hole is invaluable to scientists. It allows them to experiment on any scale, with any material, to conceptualise the size of a black hole’s singularity and event horizon. Understanding these sizes helps scientists predict the behaviour of matter around black holes of different masses and densities—much of which remains mysterious. This approach provides a strong foundation, especially considering that real black holes are influenced by additional factors such as rotation and charge.</p>
