    <h1>Schwarzschild Black Holes Explained</h1>
    <p>By Taseefah üöÄ</p>

<section>
    <h2>When Did Schwarzschild Black Holes First Appear?</h2>
    <p>The concept of black holes has been around for centuries. The earliest mentions date back to the 1700s, when Pierre Laplace contemplated the idea of objects in space with gravitational forces so immense that even light could not escape. He referred to them as ‚Äúblack stars‚Äù. At the time, however, mathematical tools were limited, and the physics of space was still largely unexplored, preventing further investigation. It was only after Einstein formulated his general relativity equations that physicists such as Karl Schwarzschild could rigorously theorise the effects of extreme gravity. One of these theoretical solutions eventually led to the rediscovery of black holes.</p>
    <div class="equation">
        $$G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$$
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>A (Not So) Short Diversion to General Relativity</h2>
    <p>Albert Einstein is famous for many things. Perhaps his most notable contribution is the classic equation:</p>
    <div class="equation">$$E = mc^2$$</div>
    <p>‚ÄòE‚Äô is energy, ‚Äòm‚Äô is mass, and ‚Äòc‚Äô is the speed of light. Energy and mass are interchangeable when the speed of light is constant.</p>

    <p>Einstein‚Äôs general relativity equation predicts how spacetime curves and how objects move depending on that curvature. Once different variations of the equation are solved, four of them dictate the four types of black holes that are theoretically possible, and one of them is Schwarzschild‚Äôs solution.</p>

    <div class="equation">
        $$G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$$
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>More About Spacetime</h2>
    <p>Space and time are not consistent values; they change depending on the observer. One assumption must be applied: the speed of light is constant and finite, approximately \(2.99 \times 10^8\) metres per second.</p>

    <p>This gives us a basic understanding of time and space dilation. Space is the distance between objects, and in spacetime, time is incorporated using the same metric by expressing it as \(ct\).</p>

    <div class="equation">
        $$d^2 = (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2$$
    </div>
    <div class="equation">
        $$d^2 = (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 + (\Delta z)^2$$
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Schwarzschild Metric</h2>
    <p>For readers interested in exploring this further, a detailed explanation and visualization of the Schwarzschild solution can be found <a href="https://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/bh/schwp.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Schwarzschild%20metric,expected%20in%20a%20flat%2C%20Euclidean" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <div class="equation">
        $$ds^2 = \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}\right)c^2 dt^2 - \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}\right)^{-1} dr^2 - r^2 d\theta^2 - r^2 \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2$$
    </div>

    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\(ds^2\) is the spacetime interval squared.</li>
        <li>\(G\) is the gravitational constant.</li>
        <li>\(M\) is the mass of the black hole.</li>
        <li>\(c\) is the speed of light.</li>
        <li>\(r, \theta, \phi\) are spherical coordinates.</li>
        <li>\(dt\) is the differential time element.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Schwarzschild radius is defined as:</p>
    <div class="equation">
        $$r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$$
    </div>

    <p>This radius tells us exactly how small a mass must become to collapse under its own gravity and form a singularity.</p>

    <h2>An Unfinished Conclusion to an Unfinished Journey of Discovery</h2>
    <p>Despite being theorized over 250 years ago, black holes remain some of the most mysterious and extreme objects in the Universe. They are massive, dense, and scattered across space, marking the deaths of the largest stars. While our understanding of black holes is still developing, mathematics allows us to describe and predict their behavior with remarkable precision.</p>

    <p>The Schwarzschild black hole serves as a fundamental model for more complex black holes, and continued study pushes the boundaries of human knowledge. Mathematics enables us to think, create, and progress as a species.</p>

    <p>Well, that's all from us for today. We hope you've enjoyed reading this article just as much as we've loved creating it.</p>
